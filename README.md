**Passo** is a WebExtension available now for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/passo/), and soon&trade; for Chrome and probably Edge.

### What does it do?

**Passo** helps users generating and, most importantly, _re_-generating strong passwords or PINs for use as part of websites login credentials, credit cards, wi-fi routers and anywhere else where 'p4ssw0rd' and '1234' are definitely not enough.

### How does it work?

With **Passo**, you just need to remember 1 password.

This password (called the _master_) will be combined with public information you provide to generate and _re_-generate strong passwords or PINs.

### Why would you want to use **Passo**?

- Creating strong passwords is a pain
- Remembering strong passwords is a pain
- Re-using the same password is going to be painful

Take the pain away with **Passo**!

### What about other password generators?

Good passwords generators will generate strong random passwords every time.

This is great, but what if we do not write them down somewhere? It is going to be really hard to remember _jN.#4556!,Ds,7p(_.

### What about passwords managers?

Password managers are awesome, but sometimes we don't have access to those managers. Perhaps is a new installation, or we are not using our devices. In those, and similar cases, a password _re_-generator comes in handy.

### What if I don't use a password manager?

You probably should. **Passo** generated passwords should be stored in a password manager.

A password manager is nice when you want immediate auto-completion of your credentials when visiting some site. Nevertheless, by using **Passo**, we know that we can easily recall passwords even if there's not a manager or we ran out of Post-it.

### What if I don't trust a third party to keep my passwords?

**Passo** does not store or remember the passwords it generates for you. These passwords are generated locally on your machine. You use them for whatever reason you need them and then they disappear... but they can be regenerated by you, the next time you need them :)

### Is it ready for XYZ browser?

This WebExtension is still under development. At the moment its version is `0.9.0` so it's almost ready. It is feature complete and you can use it right now but only if you run Mozilla's Firefox.

So, what's missing?

- a nice website
- better documentation
- time to test it with other browsers (namely Chrome, Edge and mobile browsers)
- be 100% sure that there are not security issues

I'd really appreciate if someone would want to help with any of these (and more). Open a [PR](https://github.com/msanguineti/passo/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/msanguineti/passo/issues).

### I still have questions...

I am preparing a longer and more in depth FAQ list. When it's ready, I will link it here.

It's a Promise&trade;
